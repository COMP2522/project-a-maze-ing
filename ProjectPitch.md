Our project is a randomly-generated labyrinth explorer game where the player fights enemies and avoids obstacles in order to get to the treasure. 
We will fulfill the project requirements in the following ways:
Req 1: For a visual interface, we will render the labyrinth so the user can see and interact with it. We will also implement a menu.
Req 2: We will asynchronously save the labyrinth state to a server.
Req 3: Our persistent data will be the labyrinth structure and data on enemies and obstacles.
Req 4: Our self-managing data structure will be our list(s) of enemies and obstacles.
Req 5: We will ensure that our code is without error, well-documented and complete by adhering to good coding standards and by using GitHub to evaluate and merge code that is up to standard.
Our group will have a weekly meeting on Tuesday to discuss the project. We will also have a discord chat where we can discuss the project that we will actively monitor during standard working hours of 9 AM - 5 PM. Decision making will be done using majority rule.
