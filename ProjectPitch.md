## Project Pitch (group, 1%)

The project pitch will be a short document that describes the kind of interactive application you would like to create with your group. The project pitch must include the following items:

*One-liner*: Our project is a randomly-generated labyrinth explorer game where the player fights enemies and avoids obstacles in order to get to the treasure. 
*Outline*: 
Req 1: For a visual interface, we will render the labyrinth so the user can see and interact with it. We will also implement a menu.
Req 2: We will asynchronously save the labyrinth state to a server.
Req 3: Our persistent data will be the labyrinth structure and data on enemies and obstacles.
Req 4: Our self-managing data structure will be our list(s) of enemies and obstacles.
Req 5: We will ensure that our code is without error, well-documented and complete by adhering to good coding standards and by using GitHub to evaluate and merge code that is up to standard.

*Communication policies*: Our group will have a weekly meeting on Tuesday to discuss the project. We will also have a discord chat where we can discuss the project that we will actively monitor during standard working hours of 9 AM - 5 PM. Decision making will be done using majority rule.

*Roles and responsibilities*: Matthew Siggs: Backend Developer
Alex Sichitiu: Backend Developer
Laurie Solkoski: Frontend Developer/Designer
